### Sorting algorithms

Current sorts:
- quick sort
- merge sort

To-do:
- heap sort
- bubble sort (should've started with this; would have been less painful)

Tips for creating the visualisation:
- Never start with the entire function; always start with the helper functions. Run it once on an isolated array and see if the function and DOM works as expected.
