# Sorting algorithms

Info: Pure js functions can be found in public/js

### Current sorts:
- quick sort
- merge sort
- bucket sort

### To-do:
- heap sort
- bubble sort

### Tips for creating the visualisation:
- Never start with the entire function; always start with the helper functions. Run it once on an isolated array and see if the function and DOM works as expected.
- After that, start adding in the colours and async/await

### Other to-do:
- Include option to sort ascending/descending
- Include option for evenly distributed bar heights/random
- Improve radio buttons; a little hard to click on that tiny dot
